1. In the 'skara-brae' folder, create a new file called 'overview.md', and write a short description of the Skara Brae site
2. Add two of three photos of Skara Brae to the folder
3. Add a new file called 'skara-brae-script.md', this is your fake Skara Brae 'script'. In here, write a fake programming script for visitors to Skara Brae (or anything else you want to write a fake programming script on)
4. Create a README, which decribes exactly what your script does, and explains how to use it and how to add to it
