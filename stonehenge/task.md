1. In the 'stonehenge' folder, create a new file called 'overview.md', and write a short description of the stonehenge site
2. Add two of three photos of stonehenge to the stonehenge folder
3. Add a new file called 'stonehenge-script.md', this is your fake stonehenge 'script'. In here, write a fake programming script for visitors to Stonehenge (or anything else you want to write a fake programming script on)
4. Create a README, which decribes exactly what your script does, and explains how to use it and how to add to it
4. Bonus points! Use markdown in the file, you can use this cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists)
